                Probably the easiest way for you to get an idea of how this software can help you is by looking at the
                <a class="downlink" href="screenshots.html"
                        title="some screenshots of Taekwon-Do Theory Assistant in action">screenshots</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
                The way it basically works is that you set which belt you're going for, select which kind of questions
                you want to be asked, and then start the test. If you get an answer wrong, you'll be asked it again, so
                the test won't end until you answer all of the questions correctly. I have personally found this to be
                good for actually learning the theory in the first place, not just for testing my knowledge.</p>

        <p>
                The tests go as far as the First Degree Black Belt syllabus.</p>

        <p>
                It is worth mentioning that this software has been written with the ITF (International Taekwondo
                Federation) system in mind, and refers to the moves and patterns of this system.</p>

        <p>
                For more detailed information on how this software works, take a look at the documentation, which can be
