README for Taekwon-Do Theory Assistant
========================================

Taekwon-Do Theory Assistant tests you on your Taekwon-Do theory in preparation
for your gradings. It fires questions at you and you keep going until you get
them all right. It includes exercises that go up to First Degree Black Belt
level. This program was designed with the ITF (International
Taekwondo Federation) system in mind, and uses the terminology and refers to
the moves and patterns of this system.
